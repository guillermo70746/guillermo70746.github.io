### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 
    
    Lab 1, part 1 stood out as exceptionally captivating since it marked my inaugural dive into coding. Experiencing firsthand the process behind something as seemingly basic as coding "hello" was truly eye-opening. The sense of empowerment and amazement I felt was unparalleled, instilling in me a sense of optimism and excitement for the upcoming labs.

* Lab 6

   Lab 6, part 2 held a special place for me as I had always been intrigued by the mechanics of Blackjack. It was an exciting opportunity for me to delve into writing functions that accurately determined the value of a Blackjack hand, accounting for any number of Aces dealt.

* Lab 9 

    Lab 9, part 1 was an absolute blast! It was equally intriguing as it was enjoyable, delving into the intricacies of judging events like figure skating. This experience introduced me to the "Open Judge Average" system, shedding light on the actual equation employed to determine the ultimate score. Witnessing the application of computer algorithms in calculating scores for Olympic-level sports was genuinely impressive it highlighted the remarkable advancements in technology.
